# File with functions for inverse matrix and caching the result

# Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, 
# if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
# For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

####### Working examples #######
# Create testing matrix
size <- 10 # size of the matrix edge, don't make this too big
x <- matrix(rnorm(size^2), nrow=size, ncol=size)
x_inv <- solve(x)           # this is result of solve function for compare with our results
# Here the magic begins:
xx <- makeCacheMatrix(x)    # create special object
xx_inv <- cacheSolve(xx)    # FIRST CALL - create inverted matrix
xx_inv2 <- cacheSolve(xx)    # SECOND CALL- call inverted matrix from cache
